# About

`ktl` is a versatile CLI tool for working with Kubernetes manifests. It can pull
resource definitions from live clusters or static files, apply various
transformations, and output results in various formats like *Kustomize*, *Helm*,
*CSV* and more.

Think of it as your Swiss Army knife for:

- Migrating live cluster resources to deployment & *GitOps* tools like
  `k0rdent`, `Flux`, `ArgoCD`, and others

- Normalizing and converting manifests

- Querying and analyzing resources across multiple clusters
